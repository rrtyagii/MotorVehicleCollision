# Motor Vehicle Collision
Created a web app which help us to analyse and see the results of the data set for the Motor vehicle accidents in New York City. The data set contained 1million rows and 25 colunms which taught me how to filter the data for optimum use.

## Getting Started

Download the dataset and change the DATA_URL filepath in the collision.py. 
In command prompt/terminal run: streamlit run collision.py in the project directory

## What I learnt
- Worked with Pandas, Numpy, Plotly and Streamlit, helping me to learn about Data filtering, processing and analysing 
- Extensively used Streamlit that helped me create a web app and with the help of Pydeck, I learnt to create 3D visualizations
- This project helped me to further refine my python skills
