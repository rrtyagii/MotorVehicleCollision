# Motor Vehicle Collision

We created a construction site processing, organization, and visualization platform using JavaScript, Python and HTML/CSS that provides image aggregation, localization capabilities to construction management for auditing and regulation purposes.

## Getting Started

Download the dataset and change the DATA_URL filepath in the collision.py. 
In command prompt/terminal run: streamlit run collision.py in the project directory

## What I learnt
- Worked with Pandas, Numpy, Plotly and Streamlit, helping me to learn about Data filtering, processing and analysing 
- Extensively used Streamlit that helped me create a web app and with the help of Pydeck, I learnt to create 3D visualizations
- This project helped me to further refine my python skills
